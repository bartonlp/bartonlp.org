/*
 * THIS IS A SPECIAL json. It allows comments via the 'sitload.php'.
 * Normally json_decode() would fail if there were any comments.
 * 
 * This is mysitemap.json for bartonlp.org. The 'siteload.php' file has
 * been modified to remove comments like this or // or #.
 * You can put almost anything into this file as long as it does not
 * have double slashes or a pound sign that is not escaped.
 * 'siteName' is used by the tracking software.
 * Any of these items can be referenced in code as '$this->name' like
 * '$this->siteDomain'. You can use these in the include/ file like
 * head.i.php etc.
 * The 'title' is usually used in the html <title>$this->title</title>.
 * 'className' can be used if you have a derived class from
 * 'StiteClass', then you would have:
 * $S = new $_site->className($_site->className);
 * 'copyright', 'author', 'desc', 'keywords' can all be used on the
 * include/ files.
 * 'masterdb' is the main database that all of the counter and tracker
 * data will be put into. This may be different from the
 * 'dbinfo->database' which can be different if you want to do special
 * things in a seperate database.
 * 'dbinfo' is an object used by the database software.
 * The three files 'headFile', 'bannerFile' and 'footerFile' are
 * normally in the include/ directory, but they can really be anywhere.
 * These three name have links to the actual location of the
 * corresponding files.
 * There are several special flags that can be set to modify the
 * behavior of the 'SiteClass' software these are:
 * 'nodb': don't do any database actions. This can also be done by just
 * not having the 'dbinfo' object.
 * 'noTrack': don't do 'tracking'.
 * 'count': if true we do counting if false of not included we don't
 * count.
 * The two items 'trackerImg1' and 'trackerImg2' are locations on the
 * https://www.bartonphillips.net server where the images are located.
 * If the name starts with a / then that server is used otherwise you
 * can supply a relitive link the this server or an explicit link to
 * another server.
 * 'myUrl': can either be a string, and array or the name and location
 * of a json file.
 * 'EMAIL...' tags are for your email informationl
 *
 * You can also use # or // for comments for one line comments and
 * inline comments.
 * BLP 2021-03-20 -- This is also used in the 'bartonlp' directory for
 * its 'index.php'. 'bartonlp' does NOT have a mysitemap.json.
